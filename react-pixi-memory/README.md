# React + PIXI Memory

This is a React and PIXI.js implementation of the classic game memory, which demonstrates using
the React component lifecycle to control a PIXI.js canvas. Additionally, it uses Redux for state
management and Redux Sagas for handling side effects. The images are fetched from the public Pixabay
API.
